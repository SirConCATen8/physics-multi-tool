# Physics Multi-Tool

Physics Multi-Tool is a software suite designed for in-browser or web use. Within the suite is a series of tools that can perform calculations and generate visual diagrams and references along with showing the calculation steps and results.

Currently this project is in its infancy, the individual tools will all rely on backbone tools that are also made from scratch. These backbone tools will include calculation handlers and rendering procedures. All of the tools will be available under the same licensing as described in the following section.
